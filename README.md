# Recommendation-IPTV-Experiment

A digital television service offers a large variety of TV channels
with different contents meeting different users' preferences. Unless
the user already knows what he wants to watch (the channel and the
particular program), he has to sample the content of each channel until
finding something interesting (from his perspective). Recommender
systems have been used in other contexts in order to improve user experience
through personalized recommendations. This work proposes to
use a recommender approach so that a set of channels are suggested to
the user. This set of channels is considerably lower than the whole set of
channels, and they are potentially from user's interest. To evaluate the
viability of this proposal, two well-known collaborative filtering recommender
algorithms (Weighted Slope One and Matrix Factorization) were
assessed using a real dataset. From the comparative analysis performed,
the Matrix Factorization algorithm obtains better results, appearing to
be a good choice for the implementation of a recommender system at
large-scale environment.

The code of this experiment is not organized since some parts of the experiment was done using SQL, others were performed on matlab and other were performed on Java

The results and how the experiment was conducted is detailed in: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/736321/paper_final.pdf
